### Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) interpretation
Example : **CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H** <- 3.1 IS NOT A SCORE; CVSS VERSION

| Metric                     | Acronym (Meaning)        | Possible Values                                            | Description                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Attack Vector**          | AV (Attack Vector)       | `N` (Network), `A` (Adjacent), `L` (Local), `P` (Physical) | How the vulnerability is exploited                                            |
| **Attack Complexity**      | AC (Attack Complexity)   | `L` (Low), `H` (High)                                      | How easy the attack is to perform                                             |
| **Privileges Required**    | PR (Privileges Required) | `N` (None), `L` (Low), `H` (High)                          | Level of access needed before exploiting                                      |
| **User Interaction**       | UI (User Interaction)    | `N` (None), `R` (Required)                                 | Whether a user must do something for the attack to succeed                    |
| **Scope**                  | S (Scope)                | `U` (Unchanged), `C` (Changed)                             | Whether the vulnerability affects only the target system or other systems too |
| **Confidentiality Impact** | C (Confidentiality)      | `N` (None), `L` (Low), `H` (High)                          | Degree of data exposure                                                       |
| **Integrity Impact**       | I (Integrity)            | `N` (None), `L` (Low), `H` (High)                          | Degree of data modification                                                   |
| **Availability Impact**    | A (Availability)         | `N` (None), `L` (Low), `H` (High)                          | Degree of service interruption or degradation                                 |

| **Numerical Score** | **Severity Rating** |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| 0.0                 | None                |
| 0.1 â€“ 3.9           | Low                 |
| 4.0 â€“ 6.9           | Medium              |
| 7.0 â€“ 8.9           | High                |
| 9.0 â€“ 10.0          | Critical            |
### Context awareness
|Category|Meaning|Risk Priority|
|---|---|---|
|**Internal**|The vulnerable asset is inside the organizationâ€™s **private/internal network** and typically **protected by firewalls** or other controls.|ðŸŸ¡ Medium risk (depends on lateral movement potential)|
|**External**|The vulnerability is on an asset that is **internet-facing** or publicly accessible (e.g., web servers, VPN gateways).|ðŸ”´ High risk (most exploitable and visible to attackers)|
|**Isolated**|The asset is **not connected** to the main network or is on a **segmented, air-gapped**, or **sandboxed** system.|ðŸŸ¢ Lower risk (least accessible to attackers)|
Notes:
Asset Value- Vuln scores will be higher is the asset is of high value. 
Weaponization- likelihood that an attacker will be able to weaponize a vulnerability to achieve their objectives. uses AV and AC to see the ease of the exploit. 
Exploitability- An actual exploit actually happening. A Completely Isolated Severe Vuln vs Internet Facing Low-Med Severity Vuln.
