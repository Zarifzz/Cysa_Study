### TTPs & Confidence levels

TTPs- Ways an attacker can attack
Confidence levels- When reviewing threat feeds, you may notice a confidence rating. The threats are usually ranked from high to low, with the higher numbers indicating threats with a higher-threat potential. Low numbers typically indicate threats that are more annoying than malicious.

- Timeliness- up-to-date and relevant.
- Relevancy- usefulness of the data
- Accuracy- The reliability and correctness of the threat data

**STIX/TAXII**
STIX- A standardized format for describing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) in a structured, machine-readable way. For SIEM/other sec tools ingestion
TAXII- A protocol (set of rules) for securely sharing STIX data between systems, Apps or Organizations. Used in the HTTPS level


### Collection methods and sources

OSINT- vulnerable info about a org, entity, etc. Get info from public sites like Social Media, HTML & Metadata, Goverment bulletins and Darkweb info

Both are OSINT:
**Computer emergency response team (CERT)**- is to mitigate cybercrime and minimize damage by responding to incidents quickly. Works with local law enforcement, federal agencies, and other orgs. Responds to natural disasters and terrorist attacks too. 
**Cybersecurity incident response team (CSIRT)**- a group responsible for responding to security incidents involving computer systems, Has Cyber professionals, etc. 

**Closed Source:**
- **Paid feeds**
- **information sharing organizations**
- **internal sources**- Threat intel from within the organization 

### Threat intelligence sharing

**ISACs**- For each critical industry, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) have been set up. The data is highly industry-specific and relevant. Department of Homeland Security ran entity. 
Industries/sectors like communications, energy, water, nuclear reactors and waste, emergency services, etc

Some examples:
Healthcare- targeted by criminals seeking blackmail and ransom opportunities by compromising patient data records
Aviation- substantial risks from terrorists or hostile nation-state actors seeking to disrupt services or cause casualties, has many interconnected systems, some of which use aging infrastructure or technology susceptible to interference and spoofing -> unsafe operation of aircraft. 
Etc. 

Many leading cyber-security vendors openly share threat information via the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA)
Intelligence Sharing Benefits 

| Function                 | Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incident response        | Threat intelligence sharing can help organizations respond to security incidents more effectively by providing information about threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). By sharing information with other organizations, incident responders can better understand the threat landscape and develop more effective incident response plans. |
| Vulnerability management | Threat intelligence sharing can help organizations identify and prioritize vulnerabilities more effectively. Organizations can quickly identify and mitigate potential risks by sharing information about emerging threats and vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.                                                                                   |
| Risk management          | Threat intelligence sharing can help organizations manage risk more effectively by providing insight into emerging threats and attack trends, Attack Motivation. By leveraging threat intelligence, organizations can make more informed decisions about where to allocate resources and which security controls to implement to reduce risk.                   |
| Security engineering     | Threat intelligence sharing can also help inform security engineering efforts. By understanding the TTPs threat actors use, security engineers can design and implement more effective security controls to prevent and detect attacks.                                                                                                                         |
| Detection and monitoring | Gaining threat intel helps with Threat Hunting (they know what weaknesses to look for) -> Detection and Monitoring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### Threat hunting

Assume a Breach has happened:
Make a Hypothesis -> Before you start searching, determine which threats are likely to occur. Can be recent attacks on similar organizations, result of a recently discovered threat -> based on Threat intel. 
Build a profile -> Whos the threat, how they access the systems, what TTPs/ actions would they take. 
Hunting -> actual searching for these threats, usually done through automation and with security tools. 
- Collection
- Analysis
- Application
Proactive hunting- finding threats before a incident vs active hunting- during an incident.

**Focus Areas:**

| Focus Area                      | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Misconfiguration hunting        | Misconfigurations in IT systems can create vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Misconfiguration hunting involves searching for misconfigured systems, services, or applications that attackers could exploit, including searching for weak passwords, open ports, or unpatched software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Isolated network hunting        | Isolated networks, such as air-gapped networks or networks with limited connectivity to the internet, are often thought to be more secure. However, attackers can still target these networks by exploiting vulnerabilities in connected systems or through physical access. Isolated network hunting involves searching for vulnerabilities in physical access points that could be used to gain access to the isolated network.                                                                                                              |
| Business-critical asset hunting | Attackers often target business-critical assets, such as databases, servers, or applications. Business-critical asset hunting involves searching for vulnerabilities and threats that could impact these assets by searching for unauthorized access attempts, unusual traffic patterns, or suspicious activity that could indicate an attack. An organization's processes used to manage critical assets can also be targeted, such as new user creation, money transfer, access permission approvals, and other similar high-risk functions. |
Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP)- third party company that gives security services, Can do threat hunting for you. 

**IoCs**- artifacts or forensic data that strongly suggest the presence of an intrusion, want to validate it to more confidently determine if it is a false positive, warrants monitoring, or requires a full incident response
There will always be IoCs when a successful attack is occurring
IoC <-> analyzing artifacts with digital forensics <-> Getting the Intel for Threat intelligence -> bolstering security
- Account lockout
- Concurrent session usage
- Blocked content
- UAC or popups
- Impossible travel
- Resource consumption
- Resource inaccessibility
- Out-of-cycle logging
- Published/documented
- Missing logs
- software irregularities

**Active defense** includes offensive strategies to implement maneuverability to sensitive data, the use honeypots to learn attacker's capabilities, and implement anti-malware defenses. Less resources for the Defense and more of the Attacker -> think of a honeypot. 
AV and Anti-Malware - Signature based vs Anti-malware's heuristic based, also tests sus software in a VM. 

| Honeypot Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical Honeypot           | Physical honeypots are actual devices with an IP address that are physically placed on the network. They generally provide the highest level of interaction with attackers.                                                                                                                                      |
| Virtual Honeypot            | Virtual honeypots are simulated on a physical device. They are cost-effective because multiple honeypots can be simulated on a single server or device. However, they are not as effective because attackers can more easily detect them as decoys.                                                              |
| Low Interaction Honeypot    | A low interaction level honeypot simulates a small number of services and apps on a target system or network. It is generally set to collect information about attacks such as network probes and worms. It is easy to set up and requires little maintenance and oversight.                                     |
| Medium Interaction Honeypot | A medium interaction level honeypot simulates a real OS, applications, and services. It is more realistic than a low-level honeypot and logs and analyzes more complex attacks. It requires more maintenance and oversight than a low-level honeypot.                                                            |
| High Interaction Honeypot   | A high interaction level honeypot does not simulate anything. These honeypots run actual services and applications on real computers. The honeypot can be completely compromised by an attacker, allowing full access to the system in a controlled area. It requires a high level of maintenance and oversight. |
| Production Honeypot         | Production honeypots are deployed inside the production network of the organization along with other production servers. These honeypots improve the overall security but capture only a limited amount of information.                                                                                          |
| Research Honeypot           | Research institutes, governments, and military organizations deploy high-interaction research honeypots to gain detailed knowledge about the actions of attackers.                                                                                                                                               |
