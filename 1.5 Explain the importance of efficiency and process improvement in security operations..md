**SOAR**- designed to automate some of the routine tasks ordinarily performed by security personnel in response to a security incident.
parts of a SOAR solution:
- A security information and event management (SIEM) platform
- Firewalls
- Logs (user logins, network traffic, etc.)
- Intrusion detection tools
- A user behavior analytic (UEBA) system
- Cloud and SDN/SDV APIs
- Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) feeds
- Automated malware signature creation
SOARs Scans threat intel and integrates them into playbooks. The incident response workflow of a SOAR involves playbooks, using these playbooks to follow and do the IR (runbooks). 
Can also assist with provisioning tasks, such as creating and deleting user accounts, making shares available, or launching VMs from templates. 
Provide a case management interface used by security analysts to manage and document their work. <- very similar to a ticketing system on specific issues. 
**Continuous Integration**- automates the integration of all changes made by contributors into a central repository. Central repository is used to test the current build. <- standard git hub workflow. 
**Continuous Delivery and Deployment**- Delivery: automatically deploys into the production environment all changes coders make, Continuous deployment: automatically releases to customers all the production pipeline stages. 
^^^ all changes are continuously or automatically tested and such. 
**DevSecOps**- philosophy that everyone in an organization is responsible for the security of the system. security is built-in and not a fence around apps, everyone implementing security during all stages of a project. Security automation is an important component of DevSecOps. It helps create shorter development cycles that experience fewer disruptions. 
**Streamlining Operations**- Orchestrating threat intelligence :
-> leads to faster detection of IoCs and threats -> Improved IR time; 
-> Also improves threat hunting -> more comprehensive view of the threat landscape, including emerging threats and attack trends; 
-> help organizations make better decisions about their prioritization efforts -> better allocate resources to entities that need it
-> Sharing Threat intel -> different teams and departments improving collaboration
Security operations centers- detection, prevention, and response to cyber incidents across an organization's networks. Collaborate and quickly identify security events, develop plans for mitigating the threats, strong communication skills and be able to effectively share information between team members, have established procedures for handling cyber incidents, Effective System for escalation of alters and such 
Automation leverages automated scripts, specialized software tools, and data interfaces to help the SOC team. 
**Workflow Orchestration**- workflow refers to a collection of tasks that are performed in a logical sequence,  Orchestration means that you plan these tasks to be as efficient as possible.

| Single pane of glass orchestration | Single pane of glass is a term used to describe a unified view of a computer network or system. It is a graphical user interface that allows network administrators to manage their entire network from one place. The user interface can include monitoring, configuration, and control of the network, its components, and related services.<br><br>Single Pane of Glass Orchestration is a powerful way of managing security operations. It allows security teams to see, monitor, and control all their security systems and services in one place. By combining all security services into a "single pane of glass," security teams are better able to identify and respond to threats quickly and effectively. With this approach, security teams can automate workflows, allowing them to focus on responding to threats instead of managing multiple interfaces. It also provides real-time visibility into security incidents and events, simplifying the process of responding to and resolving them. Single Pane of Glass Orchestration is an invaluable tool for improving the efficiency of an organization's security operations. |

**Scripts**- Scripts are lists of commands that can be executed by a certain program -> like Bash/Sh scripts, usually interpreted rather than compiled like code. requires runtime env 
**Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)-** is a set of functions and procedures that allow two or more applications to communicate with each other, usually used like how APIs are used rn. service 1 gives their services to another app. 

**Malware Signatures**- to reduce malware signature processing time, you can change the settings to ignore certain types of files. These file types include:
- Non-executable files
- Files over a certain size
- Files with a legitimate checksum
**Threat Feeds**- consists of a stream of threat intelligence information fed to the company through its automated systems. looks at both external and internal threats, 
**Machine Learning**- Organizations create massive databases full of user information, including preferences and activity history -> Use machine learning on this data -> analyze the data and help analysts access the data they need from these large DBs. 

**Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)-** scan systems and compare them against open cybersecurity standards -> SCAP reports back with a score indicating how well the system is doing. Where you are vs where you want to be <- Done with automation.
