## 4.1 Explain the importance of vulnerability management reporting and communication.
---
#### Process Flow (Vuln Lifecycle):
Baseline creation- this means the minimum amount of protection a device must have in place to be considered safe. Baseline requirements vary and such (org to org, high to low risk env, etc). Is documented by management. 
Vulnerability assessment- identifying vulnerabilities in the organizationâ€™s infrastructure, including the operating system, web applications, and web server. Pentesting is done here. avoid systems tanking performance or shutting down bc of the assessment. 
Risk assessment- organize the results of your vulnerability testing according to risk level and then categorize them by levels of sensitivity and access. 
Create reports and Remediations to these risks <- deal with management & documentation. 
Remediation- steps taken regarding vulnerabilities, such as evaluating vulnerabilities, locating risks, and designing responses. Remediate vulns. Start with High-impact areas -> low impact. 
Verification- verify whether all the previous phases have been effectively executed. Documented evidence that verification has been done. 
Monitoring- Continuation of security; continue monitoring these "fixed" vulnerabilities. 
### Vulnerability management reporting
Benefits- Increased awareness of vulns, Improved response by integrating vuln management info into IRPs, Improved security posture by providing metrics and measures -> tracks security posture, required to maintain compliance -> leads to better compliance. 
Reports include dashboards -> visual graphs, summary report -> overall high level summary, Detailed report -> specific, granular details on each vuln, system or app and details of remediation  

**Vuln Report Best Practices:**
- Use appropriate tools - Identify the reporting needs first and select the best tools suited to those needs.
- Consistency - Develop policies and procedures for generating vulnerability reports on a regular schedule.
- Follow best practices - Improve the effectiveness of reports by using consistent formats, standard color-coding to highlight important information, and staying focused on critical information.
- Automate - Use automation in as many processes as possible to make the entire process more consistent, reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain.
**Report Content**:
The report should detail identified vulnerabilities, such as missing patches, incorrect configuration settings, and weak passwords, and include the following:
- Details regarding the type of vulnerability
- The number of instances
- The affected systems
- The risk levels
- Recommendations

**Vulnerabilities**- everything to know about vulns: CVE id, CVSS, what is it, Exploitability, Patches or migitation for it. 
**Affected Hosts**- Hostname / IP Address, OS version, Business Function / Criticality, Internet facing/internal. 
**Recurrence**- vulnerabilities identified in an old report will reoccur in a future report even though they were previously addressed, Caused by a invalid asset inventory and invalid scans not evaluating these assets. Scans are misconfigured and run improperly due to invalid credentials, improper scan settings, invalid hostnames or IP addresses. 
**Risk Score and Priority**- Risk scores help measure the risk posed by a particular system, application, or individual vulnerability in terms of being successfully hacked or breached, this depends on many factors. Risk score then prioritizes work and to identify vulnerabilities that require immediate attention based on these scores. 
Risk scores can be used to compare to other orgs on their security posture -> determines if their security posture is adequate compared to other orgs in the same sector. 
**critical and zero-day vulnerabilities** typically warrant focused attention and should be tracked in a dashboard. The time between when a zero-day is published and when a patch is available is critical, as organizations are effectively defenseless during this time.
**Mitigations**- Detailed vulnerability reports include recommended mitigations, such as identifying a patch or describing a workaround, a permanent or temporary one. A permanent workaround addresses a fundamental flaw that is unpatchable, whereas a newly discovered vulnerability may need a temporary workaround until a patch is made available. 
**Top 10 Lists**- can help highlight potential problems or focus on important activities, trends, or environmental changes. Top 10s of many different metrics. 
**Compliance Reports**- Compliance reports provide a detailed overview of how an organization adheres to the laws, regulations, and standards of its operations.
Regulatory compliance reports- Done by qualified personnel or by the actual regulation to see whether they are following compliance. 
Internal compliance reports- Done by the Company itself, to validate whether they are doing compliance. 
**Effectiveness and Relevancy**- Reports provide vulnerabilities are most prevalent and where remediation efforts should be prioritized, include analysis and recommendations of vulns, provide actionable recommendations for remediation and mitigation

**KPIs**- measurable progress toward goals and identify areas for improvement in security operations. Orgs need accurate data to understand the effectiveness of their cybersecurity strategies. 
Includes Incidents, Detection Time, IoCs, Resource Allocation, etc
Be careful of False positives, irrelevant or incorrect KPI data. 
**Service Level Objectives (SLOs)-** security operations can measure their performance and help ensure they meet leadership's expectations. measurable, achievable, and realistic objectives. 
**Action Plans**- Part of the Vuln report, frames how to measure progress because they outline the steps, resources, and timelines required to achieve specific goals. 
begins with a a clear statement of the desired outcome and description of the steps and resources needed

##### Action Plans
**Some Outcomes:** 
**Security Policies and Training**- establishing robust security policies and procedures within an organization, writing this down in a action plan give a expected following for all. Policies can be enforced too. 
Train employees to recognize security issues and know how to respond to them. Train on recognizeing security issues and existing organizational policies and procedures
**Software Patching**- Security patches released by developers are often the first line of defense against successfully exploiting software vulnerabilities. Utilize patch management functionality, like patch testing, rolling back, and maintenance windows. Auto updates ensure patch right away, Manual patching ensures more control. 
**Compensating Controls**- provide additional layers of security to protect against malicious or accidental breaches, picks up the slack when on control doesn't work. Usually an org cannot implement a more traditional security measure due to cost, complexity, or other factors
**Configuration Management**- tracks and controls changes in a system's configuration -> ensuring that systems remain consistent, compliant, and secure due to their configs. 
**Changing Business Requirements**- Orgs are constantly changing, see how this affects the orgs security. Usually security teams and organizational leaders work independently from each other. 
Leadership teams may make decisions about operations that severely impact the environment's security. 
Security teams may not fully comprehend the impacts their security-focused decisions have on business productivity. 

##### Inhibitors to Remediation
**Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)**- legal document that outlines the terms and conditions of an agreement between two or more parties. not legally binding, with good faith. 
**Service-Level Agreements (SLA)**- legally binding contract between two or more parties that defines the level of service to be provided by one party to another. Has the services provided, the terms of service, the responsibilities of each party, and the penalties for failing to meet them. Upholding the SLA > Security practices
**Organizational governance** is the system of rules, practices, and processes an organization uses to control its operations and the strategic direction it pursues.
Board of Directors (Leaders), stakeholders (Org is accountable to them), regulators (Compliance), and the public (Public relations). 
Pressures for expanding business leads to overshadowing security initiatives. Conflicts between Security and overall Governance for a Org. 
**Business Process Interruption**- negatively impact customer service, employee morale, and brand reputation. potential to cause long-term damage to a company's reputation and profitability.
**Degraded Functionality** of Hardware/software- caused from environmental changes, age, lack of maintenance, and sometimes from applying security patches. Causes employee frustration, decreased efficiency, reduced performance, and increased costs due to repairs and replacements. 
**Legacy Systems-** not updated,  difficult to maintain, lack the ability to integrate with newer platforms. Major security vulnerabilities. 
**Proprietary systems**- specialized systems designed to serve a specific purpose and are tailored to an organization's needs. developed in-house. When security vulnerabilities are identified in these systems, they often create overwhelming trouble for in-house teams. Depends heavily on security design. Poor architectural design choices made early in development can create huge problems when security changes are needed

**Risk Score**- The risk score estimates the impact and likelihood of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability before an attack. It is suitable for estimating the probability of issues with a vendor.
**SLAs**- When a service-level agreement (SLA) breach occurs, the parties involved must renegotiate the agreement to address the breach. The renegotiation may result in a new SLA with updated terms or modifications to the existing SLA to prevent future breaches. For the Penalty, the agreement will outline the specific penalty and amount

9.2 & 9.3

**Triaging events-** Properly determining the scope of a security incident occurs during triage, careful curation of the data and tools useful in locating any indicators of compromise. Goal is to quickly identify which threats pose the greatest risk and require immediate attention, rapidly assessing and prioritizing security alerts and incidents based on their severity and urgency. 
Timeline of what, where, how, and when events occurred; Works mostly on endpoints, looking at exes and bin files, utilizing SIEMs 
**Impact Analysis**- determine the extent of damages, done in triaging.
Organization Impact vs. Localized (one department) Impact, Immediate (rightnow costs) vs. Total (Costs in dmg) Impact. 
**Documentation** is a critical part of any incident response plan. Plan documentation should:
- Be easy to read.
- Include concise guidelines.
- Document resources, policies, and procedures.
- Be easily accessible by executives and staff members.
- Be easy to refer to during an incident response event.

| Type               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incident checklist | An incident checklist provides an overview of activities that should be completed anytime an incident occurs. Incident response can be fast-paced and stressful. You can use the checklist to verify that important steps are taken.                                                                 |
| Incident form      | An incident form is used to track critical details about an incident. It should include:<br><br>- Date and time of the incident.<br>- Who or what detected the incident.<br>- Location of the incident.<br>- Type of incident.<br>- Impact of the incident.<br>- Timeline of detection and response. |
| Escalation list    | Key points about an escalation list include:<br><br>- Contact information for the person or persons responsible for responding to an incident. The contact person may differ depending on the type and severity of the incident.<br>- You should print the list and make it easily accessible.       |
**Incident Declaration and Escalation**- process of recognizing and officially declaring an event as an incident, as well as the process of escalating the incident to the appropriate personnel. 
Declaration done after identifying and confirming a security incident. declaration includes documenting the incident details, including its severity, and notifying the appropriate personnel via escalation procedures
Multiple incident Levels - Data Breach -> executive escalation, Intrusion -> SOC escalation. Must be escalated properly otherwise it will result in trouble. 
**Communication Plan**- team may require "out-of-band" or "off-band" channels that attackers cannot intercept. Using NOT compromised systems using end-to-end encryption, digital signatures, and encryption keys. IR team should have a single point of contact to handle requests and questions from stakeholders/Execs
Status and event details should be circulated on a need-to-know (Minimum info needed) basis and only to trusted parties identified on a call list. It may not be appropriate for all members of the IR team to be informed about all incident details.
**Stakeholder Management**- Stakeholders describe any individual, group, or organization that can affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome relating to an incident. essential to develop effective communication strategies to address their needs and interests.
Regular communication with stakeholders should be part of the incident response process to ensure they know the status of the incident. communicate securely
**Reporting Requirements**- Under certain regulations there are rules to follow  when it comes to incidents, GDPR data breach -> 72 hours notice to customers. <- do though email notification
**Incident Detection**- Usually Though SIEMs and IDSs, discrepancy or oddity in an application, or Threat Hunting. Early detection of incidents (before they become catastrophic) can be challenging

**Lessons Learned Meeting**- 

| Question | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who      | Who was the adversary (insider driven, external, or a combination of both)?<br><br>Who detected the incident?                                                                                                               |
| What     | What security controls would have provided better mitigation, improved response, or prevented the attack?<br><br>What security measures failed or hindered the response?                                                    |
| Where    | Where did the incident occur (host systems and network segments affected)?                                                                                                                                                  |
| When     | When did the incident occur?<br><br>When was it detected?                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Why      | Why did the incident take place?<br><br>What were the motivation and target assets?                                                                                                                                         |
| How      | How did the incident occur (tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by the adversary)?<br><br>How was the incident contained?<br><br>How long did it take to contain, eradicate, and recover from the incident? |
**Lessons Learned Report-** lessons learned report (LLR) or after-action report (AAR) Answers Questions like: What happened?, What actions were taken?, Were the TTPs known and documented in a knowledge base?, etc.
**Evidence Preservation and Retention**- 
- There is no way to know which incident, even the routine ones, could end up in court.
- During each phase of the process, you should collect and back up important evidence.
- During the post-incident phase, you should consolidate all evidence for the incident and retain it in one location.
- There may be a regulation indicating how long the evidence should be retained, how it should be gathered, and how it should be stored.
Use Tamper-proof bags w/anti-static shielding. <- with a Chain of Custody form.  Utilize hashing for data integrity. 
The chain of custody form should include where, when, and who collected the evidence, who subsequently handled it, and where it was stored, chain of custody protects an organization against accusations that evidence has either been tampered with. 
Characteristics of digital evidence, such as its type, the date it was collected and hashed, and its purpose. So evidence is neatly organized. 
**Legal Holds**- Legal team telling IT/Cyber-security team to preserve electronically stored information (ESI) and paper documents that may be relevant to a pending legal case. 
**e-Discovery** describes the electronic component of identifying, collecting, and providing the electronically stored information (ESI) identified by a legal hold
**Incident Summary Report**- 
- What caused the incident, and what security measures have been taken?
- What was the financial, systems, and reputational impact of the incident?
- How have policies and procedures been updated because of the incident?
**Root Cause Analysis-** omputer may be infected with malware, but the root cause is much deeper, Why and how the computer was infected strikes at the center of the problem. 
reveals user awareness issues, insufficient content filtering, ineffective patch management, improperly provisioned user accounts, or numerous other issues.
**Measures and Metrics**- 
- **Mean Time to Detect** - A metric that measures the average time between the initial appearance of a security incident and its detection. It is an essential metric in security incident management as it can help organizations understand potential gaps in their response processes.
- **Mean Time to Respond** - A metric that measures the average time it takes to respond to an incident. It measures the speed and efficiency of response activities related to a detected event. For example, security software tools may detect an event quickly, but staff may not effectively respond to the alerts it generates.
- **Mean Time to Remediate** - A metric used to measure how quickly an organization can resolve an incident. MTTR is a valuable metric for evaluating an organizationâ€™s effectiveness in responding to and resolving incidents.
**alert volume-** Mean time to detect may depend upon identifying trends such as alert volume, which describes the total number of specific alerts generated by a logging or monitoring system, such as a SIEM, and indicates the presence of a potentially hazardous condition.
SIEM suddenly produces more alerts for a certain type of event -> malicious activity -> faster MTTD. 
**Leadership's Dependence on IR Reporting**- responsible for managing and responding to risk in the organization -> lead to the IT team.  A program is in place to identify and respond to problems on an ongoing basis and that leadership is actively managing the risk program.
Incident response reporting is critical in helping leadership teams manage and respond to risk.
**The Executive Summary**- should provide a brief overview of the document, including the purpose, key points, and conclusion. It should include relevant background information to provide context for the rest of the document. Professional, specific and concise.
**Recommendations**- Incident response recommendations include details regarding what to do in response to the incident. 
This includes recommended changes- Lessons learned, and after-action reports are valuable sources of information to identify recommended changes to the IR process. 
**Change Control Process**- Changes made in response to a security incident should be implemented using a change control/ change management. 
1. Identify the need for a change and submit it for approval.
2. Conduct a feasibility analysis, including technical and budgetary considerations.
3. Design the method for implementing the change.
4. Implement the change.
5. Test the implementation to ensure it conforms to the plan and does not adversely affect confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility.
6. Document the change.
7. Analyze feedback.
**BCDR Threshold**- a threshold when an incident becomes a disaster, the response becomes more comprehensive and includes many levels of support across the organization. Malware on one desktop vs Malware campaign and data breach. 
**Business Continuity**- keep the organization running during and after a disaster event. development of a business continuity plan through the creation of response plans, evaluation activities, and plan maintenance. -> complete or track work using alternative methods during a disaster
**Disaster Recovery-** The tasks required to bring critical systems back online are the most crucial issue, system recovery. is a component of an overall business continuity plan. 

**Digital Forensics Process**- Incident investigations have two categories: those that support legal proceedings and those that support an organization's internal requirements. 
1. Identification
    - Ensure that the scene is safe. Threat to life or injury takes precedence over evidence collection.
    - Secure the scene to prevent contamination of evidence. Record the scene using video and identify witnesses to interview.
    - Identify the scope of evidence to be collected.
2. Collection
    - Ensure authorization to collect the evidence.
    - Use tools and methods that will withstand legal scrutiny.
    - Document and prove the integrity of evidence.
    - Store evidence in secure, tamper-evident packaging.
3. Analysis
    - Create a copy of evidence for analysis, ensuring that the copy can be related directly to the primary evidence source. The integrity of evidence copies is verified by generating hashes of the files on a recurring basis in order to detect any unintended changes.
    - Use repeatable methods and tools to analyze the evidence.
    - Analyze evidence using tools known to produce trustworthy and legally defensible results. A list of tested forensic tools is available from NIST
4. Reporting/Presentation
- Create a report of the methods and tools used.
- Present findings and conclusions in accordance to the specific reporting requirements necessary (and dependent upon the type of incident).
**Data Acquisition**- forensically clean copy of data from a device held as evidence, If the organization does not own the computer system or device, there is the question of whether search and seizure is legally valid, impacts BYOD policies -> Any mistake made while collecting and analyzing evidence will render it inadmissible in court.
Some evidence will be lost if the computer system is powered off; on the other hand, some evidence may only be attainable once the system is powered off

Evidence capture prioritizes collection activities based on the order of volatility, initially focusing on highly volatile storage:
1. CPU registers and cache memory (including cache on disk controllers, GPUs, and so on)
2. Contents of system memory (RAM), including the following:
    - Routing table, ARP cache, process table, kernel statistics
    - Temporary file systems/swap space/virtual memory
3. Data on persistent mass storage devices (HDDs, SSDs, and flash memory devices)â€”including file system and free space
4. Remote logging and monitoring data
5. Physical configuration and network topology
6. Archival media
**Mobile Forensics**- can tell you:
- Where users have been.
- Whom they have contacted.
- What media they have created.

| Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual acquisition      | Information is accessed through the device's interface. Pictures are taken of the evidence.<br><br>No tools or other devices are used, making this the simplest method. Only information available through the interface is accessible. |
| Logical acquisition     | Directories or files found in logical storage objects are copied using an API from the device's original manufacturer.<br><br>The files are copied to a computer, where it is easier to examine the data.                               |
| File system acquisition | Files are extracted from the device's database. This includes files that were marked deleted and not available from the device's interface.<br><br>This is done through the synchronization interface.                                  |
| Physical acquisition    | The entire flash memory is copied. This includes deleted files and data remnants.<br><br>You can use bootloaders to override passwords or other access blocks in order to access the flash memory.                                      |
| Brute force acquisition | You can use a brute force tool to try a large number of password combinations in a short period of time. With the password cracked, you can access the data.<br><br>These tools are intended for law enforcement and are expensive.     |
**Cloud Forensics**- cloud service provider (CSP) can store data in multiple states and even multiple countries. Each state and country has different laws and regulations, which makes jurisdiction complicated.
Steps:
1. Identify the suspicious activity or crime.
2. Collect data without tampering with it.
    You must do this through legal means and following the CSP's policies.
3. Use filtering or pattern matching to establish the questionable activity.
4. Analyze the data.
    You can do this with forensic tools.
5. Notify appropriate law enforcement if a crime was committed.
**Virtualization**- disk image file called a VMDK is a container for a virtual machine hard disk. A host machine uses a VHD file to host a virtual machine, Forensic analysis uses these two files. 
Also provides a safe environment for investigators to test theories without compromising evidence or the actual environment. 
**Legal Holds**- a legally binding order that requires the custodians of the data to preserve it until the time when it is no longer needed for discovery or litigation
- The notice identifies the data that needs to be preserved and why.
- As soon as a legal hold applies, the data cannot be altered in any way from its original form.
- Altering the data would destroy its usefulness as evidence.
- The custodians must immediately suspend any activities that would alter the data until the legal hold has been lifted.
