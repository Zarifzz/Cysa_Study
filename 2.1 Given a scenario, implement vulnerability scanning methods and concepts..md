## 2.1 Given a scenario, implement vulnerability scanning methods and concepts.
---
**Notes**:
Map scans and device fingerprinting for Asset discovery on a network
**Map scans** - mapping out assets in a network
**device fingerprinting** - identifies characteristics of what the device is, shows OS, Services, and other stuff 
**Internal vs. external scanning**- scan inside vs outside of network
**Agent vs. agentless**- using a preinstalled agent to do the scan or not 
**Passive vs. active scanning**- scanning w/out probing devices vs probing devices for a reply
**Credentialed vs. non-credentialed**- scans w/out any sign in/authorized credentials vs with these credentials. Credentialed scans are more in depth of the scan. 
**Static**- finds vulns before app runs, check source code and find flaws;
Reverse engineering- take binaries and turn it into assembly to understand exe behavior 
**Dynamic**- find vulns during the app/code is running, look for running bugs/SQLi or XSS vulns. 
Fuzzing- out in a wide variety of information/data in the input fields to try and "break" the system, to see if any errors or messages come up to find out more info on this system. 
**Security baseline scanning**- scan to evaluate current systems against the security baseline, if below that's bad. 

### Special considerations for Vuln Scanning
- **Scheduling**- Scan regularly and often to detect vulns right away; Schedule these scans during non-critical business hours, like peak times, or during a patch update. 
- **Operations**- Scanning -> bad performance; BC of this scanning follows change management procedures (operations) -> ensures business continuity exists after the operations scan 
- **Performance**- scanning causes negative performance impacts on networks or devices -> like a AV scan going on in a host. Resource sensitive networks. 
- **Sensitivity levels**- Be cautious when scanning systems that contain sensitive data, as these systems are usually very business critical and fragile, do targeted scans that are made for systems like these  
- **Segmentation**- Scans can be blocked by firewalls, ACLs, segmented networks, etc. make sure that the scans can go thorough these security controls for a proper scan. 
- **Regulatory requirements**- Scanning due to some required regulation, HIPPA or PCI-DSS, not only required its important that these scans are documented and audited according to the regulations. 


### Critical infrastructure
**Operational technology (OT)**- the hardware and software used to manage physical devices, processes, and events usually is any sort of ICS enviroment. 
Failure in OT equipment can lead to failure in certain functions in society, water treatment, HVAC, etc. 
**Industrial control systems (ICS)**- handle all machinery's workflow and automation process

| ICS Component                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Programmable logic controller (PLC)              | actuators that operate valves, motors, circuit breakers, and other mechanical components.                                                                                                           |
| Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) | Used to monitor many PLCs , Replaces a control server in in large-scale, multiple-site ICSs. Uses a WAN to field devices. ICS that covers a large area                                              |
| Human-machine interface (HMI)                    | The HMI can be a touch-screen control panel or software on a typical computer system. The HMI allows the operator to make configuration changes in the system.                                      |
| Modbus                                           | Modbus is a special network protocol that controller systems use to communicate with each other. Modbus originally ran through a serial interface but has evolved to work over Ethernet and TCP/IP. |
Harden these  OT infrastructure.  
### Industry frameworks
**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**- Regulation for for businesses that accept credit and debit cards. makes sure they handle it securely.  
12 requirements: 
1. Install and maintain a firewall.
2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters.
3. Protect all systems against malicious code.
4. Use and regularly update antivirus software.
5. Develop and maintain a secure web application and data transmission.
6. Protect all systems against loss and unauthorized access.
7. Regularly monitor and test networks.
8. Track and monitor all system components.
9. Employ strong password management.
10. Regularly review and assess the PCI DSS compliance status.
11. Maintain a PCI compliance policy.
12. Maintain a PCI compliance program with written management authorization. 
Audit frequency depends on how much card data the business is processing, once a year for minimal and quarterly for more. Attestation of Compliance (AoC) proves compliance with PCI DSS. 

**Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks**- best practices for secure configuration of IT systems and applications. These are living documents. 
Many different Configs or different situations: 
- Enterprise benchmarks for large organizations with standardized architectures. 
- SOHO/SMB benchmarks for smaller organizations
- Critical infrastructure benchmarks for the nation’s critical infrastructure organizations, including utilities and transportation.
- Cyber Defense Intelligence benchmarks for organizations that need to protect sensitive data.
- Healthcare benchmarks for organizations in the healthcare industry, including medical and dental practices and health insurance providers.
- Education benchmarks for K–12 and higher education organizations.
- Energy and utilities benchmarks for the energy and utility sectors
- Telecommunications benchmarks for telecommunications providers
- Retail benchmarks for the retail industry
- Government benchmarks for federal, state, and local government organizations.

**Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**- raise awareness of the risks of building insecure software.
Org Goals: 
- Create awareness of risks and vulnerabilities in software applications.
- Create and promote tools and resources for developers to create more secure applications.
- Provide a forum for individuals to contribute and collaborate on security initiatives through open-source software.
They provide free web application security tools or resources - OSWASP ZAP
OWASP top 10: - most occurred web app vulns. 
2021s:
1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery
Many other projects and such. (firewalls, data extraction tools, etc.) 

**International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27000 series**- Paid framework standards that define certain aspects of security: sec controls, cloud security, personal data and privacy, etc.
