## 2.2 Given a scenario, analyze output from vulnerability assessment tools.
---
Watch Video on tools
**Network scanning and mapping**
- **Angry IP Scanner**- same as Nmap with a GUI 
- **Maltego**- Helps visualize and map out a network diagram/topology. Visualizes the connections between entities. OSINT tool for getting info about entities using APIs 
**Web application scanners**
- **Burp Suite**- acts like a proxy between client and web server. Captures all the packets between the client and web server. can send special packets to web server to test vulns
	Scans for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. 
- **Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)**- do many different attacks and such; First do spidering/crawling->scans all the "components" (web dirs, URIs, pages, etc) of the website. Give you a list of alerts of potential vulns of the website and solutions for each as well. Can then exploit those vulns with Zap's different tools.  Active Scanning
	Uses a on-path (man-in-the-middle) proxy design, like Burp Suite. 
- **Arachni**- webapp auditing, gives a dynamic audit report of the webapp. 
- **Nikto**- Terminal based, can put output into a html/txt file. Gives some info about the target webapp (IP, Hostname, port, servername, link). Each vuln has the URI (where it is in the app), HTTP method, and a opensource vulns DB link. 
**Vulnerability scanners**
- **Nessus**- Has everything a Vuln scanner wants, Scheduled scans, Credentialed and un-credentialed, etc. Each vuln gives a description, solution, and links to the CVE, vulns include stuff like deprecated software and such. 
- **OpenVAS**- Is a Fork of Nessus does the same things as nessus, UI looks less appealing- is opensource, seems to be better with more hosts to scan; Can generate Vuln Scan reports, just like nessus
**Debuggers**
- **Immunity debugger**- Has 4 windows, assembly of the binary, whats in the CPU registers, hex dump (HXD), Values of whats in the memory addresses. Add Breakpoints and stop to analyze whats in these "vars" at that break point. Useful for finding out buffer overflows., etc 
- **GNU debugger (GDB)** - Debugger, essentially look and track the arguments that you have put into a exe program. Perfect for looking at low level bugs/vulns in binaries. 
**Multipurpose**
- **Nmap**- shows all open ports for a IP address host; use scripts, etc. -T4 flag for aggressive scan
- **Metasploit framework (MSF)**- exploit vulns; generate payloads; in the example to enumerate set up a reverse shell on the victim machine -> the connected shell let them enumerate the victim machine. Used for identifying and validating vulns. Has add-on modules. 
- **Recon-ng**- Web based reconnaissance. reveals an organization's external footprint, such as IP addresses, subdomains, software versions, and many other attributes. uses workspaces to help organize information has many add-on modules. CLI tool. Can load output into a database and export to a report.
**Cloud infrastructure assessment tools**
- **Scout Suite**- Vuln scanner results but for your cloud env. run command on CLI -> view the vuln report separate
- **Prowler**- For AWS, does hardening, auditing, and forensics, Checks for compliance regulations like HIPPA, GDPR, etc. 
- **Pacu**- works with AWS, pentests cloud platforms, find vulns first so you can remediate them. 


#### Some others:
Colasoft- scans ip addresses and mac addresses; traffic analysis and packet inspection, more like wireshark.
